Hi, I'm Lilach Bullock.
I'm the Conversion Optimization Faculty

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,040
Chair for Simplilearn. I'm also Digital
Marketing Consultant, Social Media

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,260
Expert, special speaker, and best-selling
author. I started my first business,

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,609
Asklilach, in 2006 and grew it
from just me to having offices and

5
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,960
employing staff. I got to work with some
fabulous people and even went to Downing

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,300
Street as a finalist for the best MumPreneur of the year.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,950
Welcome to the Advanced

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,060
Conversion Optimization course.

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,480
I understand the struggle to make online

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,620
business work for you. I've been there
and done that and that is why I want to

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,329
help you to show you what really works,
to give you the shortcuts, the processes

12
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,949
and systems, and insight you need so that,
you can make the online world work for

13
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,359
you in the way that it has worked for me,
so that you can get the results that you

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,799
need to grow your business. If you're not
doing digital right, then it really can

15
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,850
feel like a drain on your resources. Are
you spending money, time, and resources

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,130
with very little to show for it? I want
to show you a better way and help you do

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,270
it right. There's no value in driving
traffic to your website if that traffic

18
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,759
doesn't convert. More conversions mean
more revenue and, is what you are really

19
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,659
interested in. In this lesson, we will
start by defining Conversion

20
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,159
Optimization and then explain why it is
important to optimize your website for

21
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,450
conversions. By the end of this lesson,
you will have a good understanding of

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,140
the meaning of Conversion Optimization
and the difference optimizing a website

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,329
can make to the online success of your
business. Let's get started and discover

24
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,700
how Conversion Optimization can make a
real difference to your business. A

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,439
simple definition of Conversion Rate
Optimization can be found on Wikipedia,

26
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,810
which describes Conversion Rate
Optimization as, "A system for increasing

27
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,819
the percentage of visitors to a website
that convert into customers, or more

28
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,790
generally, take any desired action on a
webpage.

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:18,480
It is commonly referred to as CRO."
What does this mean in practice? Let's

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,790
start by considering two websites. They
appear identical in every way, they have

31
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,439
the same amount of daily traffic, the
same web copy, and at the start, the same

32
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,780
conversion rate. Let's assume that they
convert at 2%, that means, that out of

33
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,250
every 100 visitors to the website, two of
them will make it all the way through

34
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,590
the sales process and actually end up
buying something from the website. If just

35
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,090
2% of visitors are purchasing from the
website, that means that all of the

36
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,189
site's revenue is coming from just 2% of
the traffic. Now suppose, that one of

37
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:58,260
these websites starts to implement
Conversion Optimization strategies. Both

38
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,849
of the websites continue to receive the
same amount of traffic, so there is no

39
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,620
difference in the amount of money being
spent to promote the site. The only

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,810
difference is, in what happens once the
visitor reaches the website. The good

41
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,909
news here is that that means that all of
these issues are directly under the

42
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:23,250
control of the website owner. After a few
months of consistently working to

43
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,109
optimize one of the websites, it should be
possible to see that, while website A is

44
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:34,440
still converting at 2%, website B is now
converting at 3%. You may be thinking

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,729
that a 1% difference in a conversion
rate doesn't sound like very much, but

46
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:43,769
think about it in terms of absolute
figures. How much traffic does your own

47
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,409
website receive in an average month? If
you average 10,000 website visitors each

48
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:55,590
month, a 2% conversion rate will bring
you 200 sales. With the same traffic

49
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,409
figures, a 3% conversion rate
will produce 300 sales, that's an extra

50
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:08,129
100 sales on your website with no extra
work, or promoting your website. What sort

51
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,689
of changes can produce these results?
Conversion Optimization isn't

52
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,930
necessarily about making big changes. It
is more usually about making small

53
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,580
incremental changes over an extended
time that can lead to big results and a

54
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,320
substantial increase in revenue
over time. It might be that just altering

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,390
a single image, or one line of text could
increase your conversion rate to the

56
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,250
point that you end up making millions of
pounds more over time. Conversion

57
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,200
Optimization isn't a one-off process, it
needs to be thought of as an ongoing

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,390
operation. You make a change, and then
test that change to see how effective it

59
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,270
has been. Over time, you'll find out what
changes work and what doesn't work. Some

60
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,680
changes you might make, actually reduce
your conversion rate. If you find out

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,870
what has happened, don't panic, you
now know what doesn't work, you just need

62
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,650
to find out why it doesn't work and then
you will be in a much stronger position

63
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,210
to make the changes that will result in
higher conversions and a growth in

64
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,230
revenue. Throughout this course, we are
going to look at how you can take the

65
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,580
principles of Conversion Optimization
and apply them so that you can take

66
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,020
control of your website traffic and
transform those visitors into real sales,

67
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,430
or leads, or subscribers, or whatever you
want to do with those people who are

68
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,990
viewing your website. We will look at
each of the ways customers interact with

69
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,030
your website and see how we can optimize
each of them to maximize the benefits of

70
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,060
each of them to you. Why should you worry
about Conversion Optimization, even if

71
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,110
your website conversion rate is in gray,
can't you just get more traffic just by

72
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,940
paying for a few extra adverts and
bringing an extra sale that way? What's

73
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,780
the advantage of the Conversion
Optimization approach compared to simply

74
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,280
driving more traffic and getting more
sales that way? The best answer is that

75
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,030
Conversion Optimization works
better and will ultimately produce

76
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,710
better results for your business. By
improving your conversion rate, you

77
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,340
improve the quality of your business. You
build a stronger connection with your

78
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,630
visitors, as more of them go on to
become your customers. You improve the

79
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,620
public perception of your business, as
more of those that read your website, are

80
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,690
left with a favorable impression that
your business is useful to them. On top

81
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,370
of all of these benefits, you ultimately,
reduce your expenses as you now have to

82
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,590
buy less adverts, you increase your
productivity and your overall market

83
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,000
share as your
business grows. How are all of these

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,860
results achieved? By focusing on
continuous improvement, make more of your

85
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,270
traffic profitable. So, your advertising
budget will stretch further and provide

86
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,430
a better overall experience for
customers. Who makes the decisions in

87
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,479
your business?
What do they base these decisions on? Often

88
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,110
in a business, what you will find is, that
the person at the top makes all the

89
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,120
decisions, and getting their approval is
essential for any plan to move forward.

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,440
They will make their final decision for
any of a variety of reasons. It may be

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,759
that, they will examine all of the data
on a given subject and then follow what

92
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,870
the data says they should do. Or perhaps,
they are one of those managers that

93
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,349
bases their decision on the way that
they feel at the time of their own

94
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:29,979
personal experience. They use their gut
instinct as the basis for their decision.

95
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:33,949
Understanding how those decisions are
made, will help when it comes to

96
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,669
discussing the changes that will have to
come to your business, if you're going to

97
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:42,860
take Conversion Optimization seriously.
There is a lot of data to look at, in

98
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,719
Conversion Optimization. You could spend
weeks working through the analytics, and

99
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:52,190
seeing where people left your website
and why they didn't convert. You need to

100
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,719
try to empathize with your customers and
think about how they are responding to

101
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,639
your website. It is this balancing act,
that you must successfully complete if

102
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,380
you are to truly master Conversion
Optimization. To do this, there are

103
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,849
probably going to have to be some big
changes to the way your company thinks.

104
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,919
The customer experience must become
central to everything you do, perhaps you

105
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,639
think this is already true for your
business. But in my experience, when you

106
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,440
really start to examine the facts, it's
rarely the case. We will look at what you

107
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,250
can do one step at a time, to
revolutionize the way you do business

108
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,640
and move to a culture of customer-centric continuous improvement. Customer

109
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,399
focus and continuous improvement are the
two central pillars of business success.

110
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,870
Focus on improving your product, focus on
improving your marketing, focus on giving

111
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,610
your customers the experience they want.
What big-name companies can you think of

112
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,850
that are known for being
successful and dominating their chosen

113
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,100
market? Perhaps, you might come up with a
list of names like Sony, Apple, Hilton, or

114
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,050
Amazon. What do all companies have in
common? They place the customer

115
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,620
experience at the forefront of
everything they do. They focus on

116
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,460
providing the customer with the best
possible experience and they focus on

117
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,230
continually looking for ways to improve
that experience. Let's now go through a

118
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,580
case study to understand the importance
of continuous improvement and customer

119
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,540
focus. In the online world, Amazon are the
undisputed winners in the customer-centric

120
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,339
stakes. From the very beginning of the
company, they have always focused in on

121
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:36,140
the customer, always tried to do things
better than they were. This drive to put

122
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,370
the customer front and center has led
them to constantly improving every

123
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,360
detail of their site. You might think
that by now, they would have worked out

124
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,650
the best design for their website. But
they are still running more than 200

125
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,660
tests at any one time, constantly
striving to improve every aspect of

126
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,250
their operations. See how Amazon have
changed their website over the years,

127
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:05,060
always improving it one detail after
another. Focus for a moment on their "Add

128
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,190
to Cart" button. In the late 90s, the words
"you can always remove it later", appeared

129
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,860
by the bottom. They also included words
of reassurance, "safe" and "guaranteed". At

130
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,490
this time, internet shopping was still a
relatively new experience for many

131
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,270
people and they were keen to reassure
customers that their orders were safe

132
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,980
with Amazon. Later they removed some of
this wording and moved to Amazon

133
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,589
1-click. By this time, we were all a
lot more comfortable with buying online

134
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:38,180
and the focus for Amazon was more on
making the buying process as simple as

135
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,910
possible. Later still, Amazon introduced
Amazon Marketplace and were happy to

136
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,480
actually, let their conversion rate drop
a little bit, as they could increase

137
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,190
their revenue by selling used books. Now
it's highly profitable for them, no

138
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,870
stocks, no extra advertising, they just
earn a percentage as a broker between

139
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,339
the seller and the buyer. There is always
this balance or tension between

140
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:04,590
increasing your conversion rate and your
revenue,

141
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,320
and you have to know what the best mix
is for your business. Another important

142
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,910
principle of Conversion Optimization is
balancing your available resources. That

143
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,760
is what you have available to help in
your Conversion Optimization efforts. It

144
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,510
comes down to three types of things that
you will need if you're going to be able

145
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,730
to get anything done. You're going to
need resources, you can't use things you

146
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,650
don't have. So what do you have on hand
right now, that you can use to work on

147
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,200
Conversion Optimization? Invest whatever
you have, focus on whatever resources you

148
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,360
have on the problem, and don't worry for
now about what you don't have. You're

149
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,550
also going to need people. People are an
essential component of any Conversion

150
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,500
Optimization strategy. You need people to
identify the changes that need to happen

151
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,310
and you need people to make those
changes:

152
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,950
designers, copywriters, technical people,
they all play a part in the process. Then,

153
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,020
culture. What is your corporate culture
like? Will your approach to Conversion

154
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,490
Optimization make a difference on the
way your organization thinks? If you

155
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,260
become too focused on one area, it's
possible that your entire strategy could

156
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,020
become unstuck. It is common for everyone
to focus on traffic. There is the abiding

157
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,630
idea that the more traffic equals, more
sales. This is not necessarily the case,

158
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,910
you need to focus less on PPC and
driving traffic, and more on user

159
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,030
experience. Start conducting usability
studies, examine your copy, your analytics,

160
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,740
plan to offer a better on-site
experience. Don't worry so much about

161
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,840
things that are off your website like PPC,
focus your effort and your budget on

162
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,630
conversion rate. Remember, most websites
don't have a traffic problem, they need

163
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,890
to improve their conversion rate.
Improving the experience of those who

164
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,540
visit your site, can double your sales. If
you're really going to make progress

165
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,920
towards a coherent conversion
optimization strategy, then you will need

166
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,140
to consider three specific areas:
marketing, graphic design, copywriting,

167
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,110
creative resources,
and technical.

168
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,470
Someone within your organization will
have to take ownership of the Conversion

169
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,390
Optimization project and push it forward
in all of these areas. One of the

170
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,140
greatest dangers with their strategy is,
that it becomes the responsibility of

171
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,820
one department, one area of your company,
and people begin to work individually,

172
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,650
rather than as a team.
You must get everyone on board with what

173
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,190
you are doing and shift your corporate
culture, if you're going to make this

174
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,230
work. Everyone from marketing to the
creative people, the designers, copywriter,

175
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,520
the flash people, to those who copy and
paste code to your website to make the

176
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,320
changes you need, they all have to know
where this process is leading and what

177
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,550
the ultimate goal is. You need resources,
but most of all you need the process:

178
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:11,060
Plan, measure, improve, repeat. Visitors
come to your websites for a variety of

179
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,290
reasons. But they all have at least some
level of interest in you or your brand,

180
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,730
otherwise, they would not be there.
Once they reach your website, it is your

181
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,420
job to persuade them to buy. To do this,
you will need to think through your

182
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,430
persuasion architecture process, that is
the process you go through to persuade

183
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,990
someone to take the all important step
and actually buy from you. There are

184
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,010
three parts to this process, or rather
three questions that you will need to

185
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,320
ask: Who are we trying to persuade? It's
much easier to make a sale if you know

186
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,340
the person you are talking to. You know
what appeals to them and where their

187
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,150
interests lie. You can adapt your selling
approach to answer all the questions

188
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:55,850
that they are likely to have. What action
do we want them to take? You must be

189
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,570
clear about the actions you want your
reader to take: do you want them to

190
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,700
forward a link, buy something, subscribe
to your list, download something, it must

191
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,410
be a clearly defined path for them to
follow, not just in terms of big actions,

192
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,000
think of the micro-action level as well,
what action should they take on this

193
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,190
page and next page and next page, all the
way through from the landing page to

194
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:26,150
final conversion. What actions do they
want to take? People have a variety of

195
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,020
goals in view, when they reach your
website. You may want them to do one

196
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,880
thing, they may have a completely
different goal in view.

197
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,560
They are in control of the experience
they have on your website. They want to

198
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,540
accomplish a particular task, we must
help them to accomplish their task while

199
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,070
at the same time, helping them to take
the action we want them to take. In this

200
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:53,130
way, they will be a satisfied customer and we'll also achieve our goals. If you

201
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,730
know anything about human nature, then
you know that human beings are all

202
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,410
different. Some of us are more logical,
some are more emotional in the way we

203
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,640
respond to situations and the way we
gather and process information also

204
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,770
varies. Some of us are more spontaneous
in our actions, while others take a more

205
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,540
logical approach to the buying process.
This different approach to information

206
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,580
gathering can be seen in the way people
consume the information on your website.

207
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,590
Studies show that there are four unique
patterns of eye tracking over websites.

208
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,220
People that are more competitive, tend to
focus their gaze on the top of the page.

209
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,650
Those who are more methodical in nature,
will look at all of the different data

210
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,540
points on the page, study the page
navigation and see how everything is

211
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:45,300
connected. Then there are the spontaneous
type of people, these are attracted to

212
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,550
interaction, they like pictures of people,
they like to see what's going on. Finally,

213
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,800
there are the humanistic types, these
visitors are little more deliberate, more

214
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,360
emotionally involved with the page. Each
of these types of person is going to

215
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,380
approach a webpage differently, they are
all going to want to see different

216
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,699
things if you're going to persuade them
to buy from you. We need to work out the

217
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,020
goals of each of these different types of
visitors. And to help us do that, we

218
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,569
create personas, buying models to help us
determine what each customer wants to

219
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,939
achieve on your website. In addition to
these personality types, we can divide

220
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,990
your visitors into other groups as well.
There are people who know about your

221
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,170
company, compared to those who don't know
anything about your business and what

222
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,330
you can do. There are returning buyers
and new customers. They all start from

223
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,740
different levels of knowledge and have
varying expectations from your business.

224
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,740
There are also different ways visitors
reach your website, that can have

225
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,309
effects on how they feel about your
business and what they are expecting

226
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,050
from you. So we could segment your
visitors by those who arrived by a PPC,

227
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,780
and those who came to you from social
media. We can make the segmentation as

228
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,190
simple or as complex as we wish.
The object is to help us create the

229
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,750
content for each of these groups of
people needed to complete the sale. We

230
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,429
need to build empathy with them. To do
this, we will be testing every aspect of

231
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:18,440
your web page. There are tools that can
help you do this. The Analytics Content

232
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,360
Experiments in Google Analytics allows
you to test every element on your page

233
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,790
and see if it will appeal more to
competitive or methodical personality

234
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,210
types.
Tools like this can be useful and will

235
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,260
help you make important decisions about
which elements to include in your

236
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,240
webpages. You can't change every aspect
of your website at once, or you won't

237
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,650
know which changes affected your
conversion rate. Start small, one change

238
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:51,020
at a time. This is the power of this tool.
5% may not be much, and it only takes a

239
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,570
few hours a month to get to that point.
But compounded over a 12-month period by

240
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,750
the end of the year, you will have
increased your conversion rate by more

241
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:04,880
than 80%. The key to reaching this
point is, to focus on improving your

242
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,010
corporate metabolism. No single perch is
going to achieve your long-term goals, it

243
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,720
must become a way of life for everyone
at your business. Constantly seizing your

244
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,240
opportunities and increasing your market
share

245
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,280
step by step, this process works, the
question is, will you work the process

246
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,970
and achieve your goals? In this lesson, we
have seen that Conversion Optimization

247
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,740
is about making small incremental
changes to your website over time. We

248
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,940
have said that optimization is an
ongoing process, not something that you

249
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,660
do once and then leave. You have learned
that there are different approaches to

250
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,620
information gathering and above all, we
have seen the importance of being

251
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,830
customer-centric in every area of your
operation.
